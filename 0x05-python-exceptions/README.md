	Exceptions are simply errors that occur during execution of a program but do the program is correct in terms of syntax
## This directory contains exceptions handling by use of the the try and except clause
### The syntax is usually
	try:
		statements one excepts to run and this statements may result to an exception
	except <error>:
		this statements are executed if try clause results to an exception
	else:
		(Its optional)Usually executed if the try statements executes without occurance of any exception
	finally:
		(also optional)It executes regardless of anything
* in the except clause (<error>) is the a specific error and its optional also if left out except will stand in for all the exceptions
